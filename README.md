Scoreserver
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xyproto/scoreserver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xyproto/scoreserver)

REST/JSON server for managing users and scores


Technologies involved
---------------------

* Server programming language: [go](https://golang.org)
* Authentication: [HTTP Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
* Database backend: [Redis](http://redis.io/)
* API style: [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)


Suggestions for additional technologies 
---------------------------------------

* Webserver for http/https, and proxy for server apps: [nginx](https://nginx.org)
* Encryption: [HTTP over TLS/SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure)


Requirements
------------

* redis and go (the package is often named "golang")
* Use HTTPS whenever using HTTP Basic Auth


Terms used
----------

* ANY can be GET, POST, PUT or anything
* For an URL like /api/1.0/create/:username/:password, :username should be replaced with the desired username and :password with the desired password, when making the HTTP request.


Admin user management
---------------------

* HTTP GET **/**
  * Reveals if an administrator user has been created or not.

* HTTP ANY **/status**
  * Reveals if an administrator exists and the login status.

* HTTP GET **/admin**
  * Administration panel. Not implemented yet.

* HTTP GET **/register**
  * For registrating a new administrator by filling in a form.

* HTTP POST **/register**
  * For registering a new administrator, needs the form names 'password1', 'password2' and 'email'.
